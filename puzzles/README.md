# Puzzles

### Objective

For this assignment you'll be solving three puzzles using JavaScript.

### Instructions

Open the file `index.js` and fill out the function bodies for each of the functions.

1. **Even or Odd**

    For this problem the `evenOrOdd` function will receive an integer and must return `"Odd"` if the number is odd or `"Even"` if the number is even.
    
    For example:
    
    - `1 => "Odd"`
    - `2 => "Even"`
    - `15 => "Odd"`
    
2. **Words in Reverse**

    This function will receive a string with multiple words. Your task is to return the same string but with the words in reverse order.
    
    For example:
    
    `"the quick brown fox jumped" => "jumped fox brown quick the"`
    
3. Count Positives, Sum Negatives

    This function will receive an array of numbers. All numbers will be positive or negative (no zeros). It should count the number of positive numbers and sum all of the negative numbers together. The function will return an array with the number of positives and the sum of negatives.
    
    For example:
    
    `[ 1, 2, -1, -2 ] => [ 2, -3 ]`
